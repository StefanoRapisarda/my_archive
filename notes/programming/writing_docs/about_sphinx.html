    <h1>About Sphinx</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>What I've learned from the first website page</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sphinx was originally created for python documentation;</li>
            <li>The output formats include PDF, latex, and epub among others. 
                Apparently you can even write a book with Sphinx (check Packt);
            </li>
            <li>It uses reStructuredText, a markup language;</li>
            <li>You can use it with many themes like alabaster, classic,
                nature (pandas, cython, PyWavelets), etc; </li>
            <li>Read the Docs is not a competitor of sphinx as I thought,
                but rather a place to host your documentation for free;
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>From getting started</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color:blue">DEF:</span> Sphinx is a <em>
                documentation generator</em>, i.e. a tool that translates a 
            set of plain text source files into various outout formats;</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>First steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Install sphinx with <code>python -m pip install sphinx</code>;
            </li>
            <li>
                Verify sphinx installation with <code>sphinx-build --version</code>;
            </li>
            <li>
                From the command line, inside your selected folder, run
                <code>sphinx-quickstart docs</code>. This will ask you a series
                of questions (answer yes to the first one) and will create a 
                new docs folder. Inside this folder, in particular, you will
                find that the <code>source/index.rst</code> file is the root document of
                the project, which serves as welcome page and contains root
                of the "table of contents tree" (toctree);
            </li>
            <li>
                To export your documentation in html (or any other format)
                run the command <code>sphinx.build -b html docs/source/ docs/build/html</code>. 
                After this first build, when you modify the .rst file you can 
                simply run <code>make html</code> inside the docs folder;
            </li>
            
        </ul>
