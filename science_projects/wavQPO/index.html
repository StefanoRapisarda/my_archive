        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The project focuses on the QPO type switch observed with NICER,
            so, naturally, the dataset consists of the same NICER data used
            in Homan et al. 2020 and HXMT observations. According to Homan et al. 2020
            the transition happened on July 6 at 16:15UTC. It seems that 
            HXMT just missed the transition... however there is data collected
            on the 6th and 8th of July.

                    The evolution of the outburst is broadly devided 
                    into three branches: low-hard state (MJD 58189-58290),
                    high-soft state and transitions (MJD 58290-58400),
                    and low-hard state again (MJD 58400-58443);
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before MJD 58195 emission seems to be affected by
                    the presence of a warm absorber, this resulted in 
                    strong, spectrally hard, dips;
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first hard-soft transition seems to happen
                    between MJD 58302 and MJD 58308 (2018 July 3-9);
                </li>
                <li>
                    In July 6-7 (so between July 6 and 9) a QPO transition
                    (from C to B has been observed). At the beginning
                    of this period Type-C QPOs have been originally observed
                    at frequencies 4.5 and 9 Hz, respectively. The transition
                    is specifically observed at MJD 58305.67740 (July 6 16:15 UTC).
                    A type-B QPO was clearly observed at this time with 
                    frequency around 4.5 Hz. The type-B QPO was only 
                    present for five GTIs (4100s) during which it slightly
                    decreased to about 3Hz. As in the transition the 
                    luminosity of the source increases, some of the 
                    detectors have been shut off because of telemetry
                    problems. The combination of intrinsic weakining of 
                    the feature and reducing effective area, made subsequent
                    detection of the Type-B QPO uncertain. Type-B QPO
                    desappeared after MJD 58305.81136, July 6 19:28 UTC).

                    Fitting AMI-LA radio lightcurve between July 5 and 8 
                    (MJD 55304.77201-58307.15169) with three components 
                    addressing respectively the baseline decay, the radio
                    flare, and the radio flare decay, they managed to extrapolate
                    the radio flare start time with high precition. They
                    found a start time of MJD 58305.773 &#177 0.006 (July 6
                    18:33 UTC, with a statistical uncertainty of about 10 minutes);
                </li>
                <li>
                    They found that the estimated flare start is about 2-2.5 hr 
                    later than the time at which the type-B QPO appeared;
                </li>
                <li>
                    The appearence of the type-B QPO coincided with the start 
                    of a small flare in the 7-12 keV energy band. The flare 
                    duration and the detection time interval of the Type-B 
                    QPO seem to be the same;

                    This is a kind of unique dataset because it captured 
                    the moment at which a narrow Type-B QPO appeared around 4.5 Hz.
                    In the previously studied sources this switch, o transition,
                    between Type-C and Type-B QPOs always happened during 
                    gaps in the X-ray coverage;
                </li>
                <li>
                    They measured the transition with accuracy, but they could 
                    not do the same for the duration of the Type-B QPO. 
                    Perhaps this time can also give some hints about the 
                    relation betweem radio flares and Type-B QPO.

                <li>
                    One of the main goal of this project is (or became) 
                    getting a high precision measurement of the gap between
                    QPO appearence and jet lauch. The physical meaning of this 
                    delay and its meaning in the context of jet models must 
                    be discussed. This is also to highlight the importance 
                    of methods to achieve such high precision measurement;
                </li>
                <li>
                    About why the frequency becomes lower, I can discuss 
                    the phenomenon in the context of the precessing flow 
                    model. For that, I would need to look for more existing
                    information about the geometry of the flow during this 
                    transition, specifically about the truncation ratio;
                </li>
                <li>
                    It seems that the main competing models for Type-B (and 
                    perhaps C) QPOs are 1) precession model and 2) base of 
                    the jet model. I know basically nothing about the latter, 
                    but it seems that the simultaneous presence of hard X-ray 
                    flares (due to ejections) and Type-B QPO would strenghten 
                    the case for a jet-based origin of the Type-B QPO. <br>
                    On the other hand, the precession model would explain 
                    the Type-B QPO simply as Type-C QPO, but with a depleted 
                    inner disk. If this is true, we expect a decrease in 
                    variability at high energy (as pointed out in my paper 
                    in 2014). This could be a point of discussion (precession 
                    model vs. base of the jet model);

        <h2>General considerations</h2>
        <div>
            <strong>Reading [1]</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the very beginning of my "wavelet adventure", the 
                    goal of applying the transform to QPO analysis was very
                    ambitious, i.e. characterizing the morphology of the 
                    signal. After playing a bit with simulated signals, I've
                    realized that this is particularly difficult when we 
                    are dealing with weak signals on top of broad band noise.<br>
                    However, reading Jeroen paper, I've realuized that wavelet
                    analysis could provide a very precise measurements of
                    minimum and maximum QPO frequency, introducing in this
                    way a new tool to add high precision measurements to 
                    the current phenomenology.<br>
                    The new goal of this project is therefore measuring QPO
                    frequency with high precision and monitoring these 
                    changes along state transitions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This paper shows that with simple fitting it is possible 
                    to extrapolate the radio flare starting time with relatively
                    high precision (statistical error of about 10 minutes). In 
                    the broad picture of investigating the connection between
                    Type-B QPO and radio jets, it is fundamental to establish
                    the transition or appearence of Type-B QPOs with 
                    comparable high precision. The wavelet transform could 
                    provide that;
                </li>
                <li>
                    The appearence of the Type-B QPO is simultaneous to 
                    drop in strength of broad band variability. I wonder how 
                    this variability would look in the wavelet transform;
                </li>
                <li>
                    A very important thing to consider for this kind of 
                    study is gaps. Ideally you want no-gaps data for both 
                    X-ray and radio sources, but as the paper shows you can 
                    still extrapolate the radio flare start time with fitting. 
                    Unfortunately you cannot do anything similar for the 
                    Type-C --> Type-B QPO transition. So, first thing to check, 
                    no gap data around the switch;

            <li>
                What happens if I compute the average power spectrum averaging
                n global power spectra (from the wavelet transform) instead 
                of n spectrogram? What would be the statistical differences 
                between the two?
