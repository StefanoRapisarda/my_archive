                <h3>Cover Slide</h3>
                Good morning everybody. First of all, I would like to 
                thank Diego and Mariano for having solecited this talk.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Outline</h3>
                In this half an hour I am going to talk about propagating
                fluctuations models. I've decided to follow a pedagogigal
                approach focusing more on concepts instead of the math.
                I will start setting the general background for our discussion,
                and then I will introduce both the hypothesis of propagating 
                fluctuations and its implementation. We will then have a look
                at some applications of the models on data and finally
                it will be time to discuss the current state and future 
                perspectives for this kind of models.

                <h3>Modelling the variability</h3>
                What you see in this slide is on the left energy spectra 
                and on the right power spectra of three accretion states 
                in black hole x-ray binaries. During a typical outburst 
                an x-ray binary goes through these states and all kind 
                intermediate states characterized by, as you can see,
                specific spectral and timing properties.</br>
                </br>
                We believe that each state corresponds to a specific geometry
                of the accretion and the way we estimate the parameters of 
                these geometrical configurations is by modelling the available 
                information, the energy spectrum and the fast variability,
                that here is represented by the power spectrum.</br>
                </br>
                When I started learning about this I always had the fealing 
                that somehow the modelling of the variability was lagging 
                behind the modelling of the energy spectrum and I think
                this is because of a very obvious reason. The emission mechanisms
                responsible for the observed flux in X-ray binaries were 
                already well known before the discovery of X-ray binaries.
                I am talking about black body emission and Compton scattering,
                of course they had to be adjusted to the environment around
                compact objects, but still they were there to be used. On the  
                other hand modelling the variability is a totally different 
                challenge, because we are dealing with stochastic or random 
                variations, to the point that one may ask, is it that 
                important modelling the variability with a physical model? 
                Well, it is.</br>
                </br>
           
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Importance of timing modelling</h3>
                To make my point even more explicit, I always like to show
                these pictures. On the left you see two energy spectra 
                from the low hard state of Cygnus X-1 and XTE J1550. As 
                you can see the energy spectra are very similar to each other,
                but when you look at the timing properties, they could not 
                be more different. The first two panels are power spectra 
                in a soft and hard energy band and the last panel is the 
                phase lags.<br>
                <br>
                My point here is that nowadays any study that has the 
                ambition to unveil the geometry of accretion around black 
                holes, and in general compact object, must include 
                modelling of both spectral and timing information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What to model?</h3>
                Ok, so we need a model for the variability, what exactly
                do we need to model?
                In this slide you see a typical power spectrum of black 
                hole X-ray binaries during the hard state. You can 
                see it is characterzied by both broad band noise, spanning 
                several decades in frequency, and narrow features that we 
                identify as QPO. Both these features are energy dependent,
                with variability at high frequency usually increasing
                with energy. Both these features have associated time 
                lags that are also energy dependent and increase with energy.
                Here there is a less obvious characteristic of the variability,
                i.e. the linear relation between absolute RMS and flux at 
                different time scales. Without going to much into details,
                this tells us that different time scales of variability are 
                correlated, something it is important to remember for our 
                later discussion.
                Finally, of course, all the characteristics evolve during
                the evolution of an outburst, so our model has also to be
                able to explain such changes.<br>
                <br>
                As you can see this is a quite long list of criteria that
                our physical model needs to satisfy and I guess you start 
                to understand why the modelling of the variability lags 
                behind the spectral modelling. Anyhow, it comes out that
                there is an hypotheis able to exaplain, at least qualitatively,
                all these characteristics and, surprise surprise, this is 
                the hypothesis of propagating fluctuations;
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The propagaing fluctuations hypothesis</h3>
                This hypothesis was first proposed by Lyubarskii in 1997 
                and I will try to exaplain it with this animation. <br>
                <br>
                ...
                <br>
                One fundamental concept to understand about these scanario is that,
                because of this propagating mechanism, somehow the disk keeps
                memory of the variability generated in it. So that, for example,
                even if the outher part of the disk is not observable, its
                characteristic frequencies will be transferred to the inner 
                part of the disk, where most of the energy is released, so that 
                emission from this inner part, even if it is phisically
                very small, will be characterized by variability 
                with a very broad range of time scales.<br>
                <br>
                Other two important assumptions of this scenario that need 
                to be rememebr are:1) that 
                the characteristic time scale of the variability increases with radius,
                so that we have fast fluctuations close to the black hole 
                and slow fluctuations far from the black hole and 2) That 
                the emission of the inner disk is harder than the outer disk.
                This second assumption is fundamental to observe phase 
                lags between a soft and a hard energy band.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Power Spectrum from fluctuations</h3>
                In this other animation you can see fluctuations arising 
                in each ring of this accretion flow, you can see the fluctuations 
                in the time domain on the left and their power spectrum on the 
                right. We have slow fluctuations far from the black hole 
                modulating the faster fluctuations close to the black hole.
                As you can see the result of this propagating mechanism 
                is a broad band noise feature.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Power Spectrum from fluctuations2</h3>
                Here you see another example of power spectra result of 
                propagating fluctuations in a soft and hard energy bands,
                as you can notice the hard power spectrum is higher at higher 
                frequency as we expect the high frequency variability 
                to be more dominant at high energies, and a natural outcome 
                of propagating fluctuations model is phase or time lags 
                between the soft and hard energy band.<br>
                <br>
                So basically this propagating fluctuation model can predict 
                energy dependent broad band variability, hard phase lags, 
                because propagation is a multiplicative process it also 
                reproduce the linear RMS-flux relation, what we need is 
                something to model the narrow band features, the QPO.
                Propagating fluctuations models of course cannot explain
                that, but they can be combined with other models. For example
                assuming a truncated disk geometry where the entire inner 
                flow precesses because of frame dragging close to the black hole,
                you can add a QPO signal on top of the broad band noise.

                <h3>Implementing the model</h3>
                This all seems a very nice story, but how did I make That
                power spectrum plots, how did we implement this hypothesis?
                This propagation mechanism seems very complex to code? Do we need 
                to use MHD simulations or radiative transfer code?
                Well it turns out that there are relatively easier ways to 
                implement this hypothesis.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Implementing the model</h3>
                The way we implement the model starts dividing the disk,
                or the accretion flow, into rings or annuli. As we said, 
                stochastic mass accretion rate fluctuations are 
                stirred up in each ring, but how to we reproduce stochastic flcutuations.
                Well, we assume that these fluctuations are the result of 
                a certain process and that this process can be described by
                a power spectrum. We choose as power spectrum a zero-cetred 
                Lorentzian bending at the local viscous frequency (that is 
                just the frequency associate with the local viscous time scale). 
                Why this function and not, for example, something 
                that looks like white noise? Because looking at the 
                solutions of the diffusion equations 
                we find out that, when looking far away in the disk,
                 variations shorter than the local viscous time 
                scale are heavely dumped, so we use a function that behaves 
                basically as white noise below the viscous frequency and 
                then rapidly decade at higher frequencies. There are also 
                mathematical reasons to choose a zero-centered Lorentzian,
                but I am not going into details about that.
                Well, once we choose the fourier power spectrum of our 
                fluctuations, we need to simulate the stochastic time series
                from it, a single realization of this process using the 
                Timmer and Koenig prescription. Mass accretion rate fluctuations
                in a ring are then converted into flux variability via a weighting factor.
                Here I indicated it with s to denominate the soft energy band, but 
                each energy will have its own weighting factor. 
                then we consider the next ring, the mass accretion rate fluctuations
                stirred up in the next ring have the same shape of the previous 
                one (centred Lorentzian), but its bending frequency is higher,
                as the local viscous frequency is higher. This time, we don't 
                convert direct these fluctuations in time, but we multiply 
                them by the fluctuations of the previous ring shifted of 
                a certain time delay. The time delay is the time that fluctuations 
                take to propagate from the previous ring to the current ring.
                We repeat this process for all the ring and we obtain in this 
                way a full lightcurve in several energy bands that we will 
                use to model our data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Implementing the model</h3>
                This randomize-shift-multiply
                algorithm has two main problems: 1) first, it can be 
                computationally very intensive and 2)we are still working 
                with a single realization of the process that we assume. 
                Luckely for us there is a much more efficient way to obtain 
                analitically power and cross spectra, so avoiding the multiplication
                cycles in your program. Michiel van der Klis came out with 
                this idea in 2012 and then together with Adam they worked 
                out the math. This is the method that is used in the most 
                recent works on propagating fluctuations, but I decided to 
                spend sometime to describe the Timmer and Koenig algorithm 
                both because it's more intuitive and becuase it is fundamental 
                to anderstand the Ingram & van der Klis implementation.
                I am not do go into detail into this implementation, but 
                I want to highlight a fundamental difference. the Ingram 
                and van der Klis implementation works mainly in the frequency 
                domain, this means that if you want to introduce some  kind 
                of time variability and interacts with the fluctuations in 
                a non-linear way, this cannot be done using this implementation.

                <h3>Implementing the model wrap up</h3>
                So, to conclude this section about implementing the model,
                I want just to highlight that, in order to properly implement 
                that quite simple idea of propagating fluctuations, you 
                have to make an additional set of assumption related to 
                the characteristics of these fluctuations. What is their 
                power spectrum? Do they have a characteristic frequency?
                Yes the viscous time frequency, then you need to assume 
                a radial viscou frequency profile, i.e. how the viscous 
                frequency changes in the disk. How fast do these fluctuations 
                propagate, and we assume that the viscous time scale also 
                sets the time the fluctuations need to propagate. Then 
                you neeed to make assumptions about the amplitude of the 
                fluctuations and also the emissivity. All these assumptions
                establish the link between the geometry of the accretion flow 
                and the observed variability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Modelling BH-XRB variability</h3>
                Well let's talk about these assumptions more in details and 
                let's see what happens when we compare model predictions 
                to data.
                In this slide you see a schematic view of a accretion geometry 
                that we assumed in our work in 2016 and 2017. We assumed a truncated 
                disc geometry, where a optically thick geometrically thin accretion 
                disk is truncated at a certain our radius. Inside this radius,
                accretion takes place via a geometrically thick optically thin 
                accretion flow. We assumed mass accretion rate fluctuations 
                propagating both in the disk and in the flow, but as you 
                can see from this sketch, we assumme only the inner part 
                of the disk to be variable. The green line is the viscous
                frequency profile, what sets both characteristic time scale 
                and propagation time of the fluctuations. In the disk 
                it simply comes from Shakura-Sunyaev solutions, while 
                in the hot flow it's assume to be a power law. The dashed 
                purple line rapresents the amplitude of the fluctuations.
                In the flow is constant per radial decade, while in the disk 
                we assume it to be a Gaussian peaking at the truncation radius.

                <h3>Modelling BH-XRB variability case1</h3>
                Every time you have a new shining model, there is always
                the tendency to select that single observation that match 
                almost all your model predictions. With Adam and Michiel 
                in 2017 we decided to do something different, I explored 
                all RXTE archive of many sources and I selected two 
                cases of study according to the signal to noise and to 
                how badly the model was going to fit the data.
                Here you see the first case, the source is XTE J1550 during 
                the rise of its ourburst in September 1998, so we are in the 
                low hard state and the power spectrum consist of a broad band 
                component with a beutiful narrow QPO and second harmonic 
                on top of it. Data are in black, model predictions are in 
                red. The upper plots are power spectra in a soft and hard 
                energy band, while on the bottom left we have the cross-spectrum 
                and on the bottom right the phase lags. 
                All this information was fitted simultaneously, and that
                is what you should always do with propagating fluctuations 
                model predictions. It does not make much sense to fit 
                just the power spectrum, you need to fit the power and 
                the phase lags in at least two energy bands.
                As you may notice, the model well reproduce the shape of 
                the power, but it underestimate the magnitude of the lags.
                Let's go a bit deeper into the implications of this descrepancy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Modelling BH-XRB variability case 1: problems</h3>
                Let's go back to our model assumption. We have a propagating 
                region where the viscous frequency decreases with radius,
                so fast variability happens close to the black hole and 
                slow variability far from the black hole. We also assumed 
                that the spectrum of rings close to the black hole is harder,
                so soft photons come mainly from the outer region of the disk,
                hard photons from the innermost region of the disk.
                Now let's go to the data. Here the shape of the power 
                in the soft and hard energy band is very similar. This means 
                that every ring contribute in the same way to the variability 
                in the soft and hard band. In order to reproduce this situation,
                what does our fitting algorith do? It adjust the emissivities 
                of the two energy bands so that each ring will provide the 
                same contribution to the variability in the soft and hard band.
                But if the two emissivities, in the hard and soft band,
                are almost identical, this means that, even if fluctuations 
                propagate in the disk and flow, I would see a very small 
                lag because my two energy bands are targeting the same 
                geometrical region and not to disk regions that are far 
                apart from each other.
                Indeed the phase lags in this fits are very low.

                <h3>Modelling BH-XRB variability case 2</h3>
                Few days later the situation did not get better, this time
                the model failed also to predict the shape of the power in the 
                hard band, where we observed a low frequency sholder. This 
                is again very at odd with model predictions as we would expect 
                extra variability at high frequency.</br>
                In this work we showed that using the simple recipe of fluctuations
                propagating in a disk + innerflow geometry, you may find quantitative
                and, especially, qualitative between data and model that 
                may require more elaborate physical scenarios to be explained.
                One of the good outcomes of our approach is that it quickly
                stimulated other works on this case.

                <h3>Modelling BH-XRB variability Veledina</h3>
                One year later, Alexandra Veledina used the propagating 
                fluctuation hypothesis with a different geometry. In this case 
                inner part of the accretion disk extend within the inner 
                boundary of the hot flow. the propagating fluctuations cause 
                variation of the disk seed photons, and so the Compton upscattered 
                photons in the flow, but also variations in the flow density.
                This last variations are transferred into variation of the 
                Compton upscatted synchrotron emission coming from the hot 
                flow itself. Because these two emission interfere with 
                each other, the resulting power spectrum may present a shape
                that deviates from the smooth single hump of our model.
                Time or phase lags arise because disc Comptonization 
                happens usually before the synchrotron comptonization.
                Using this scenarion Alexandra obained a good agreement 
                between data in our second case and model predictions. 
                Furthermore, the interference between these two emissions 
                could also explain the deviations from the linear-RMS 
                relation often observed during intermediate states.

                <h3>Modelling BH-XRB variability Mushtukov</h3>
                An other interesting study about propagating fluctuations 
                is the work of Alexander Mushtukov together with Adam 
                Ingram and Michiel van der Klis. If you remember the 
                animation I showed you when talking about diffusion in the 
                disk, you may have noticed that the ring spred in the disk
                not only towards the black hole, but also outwords. This 
                effect is not contemplated in the simple scenario I described 
                before, but Alexander used a more rigourous treatment 
                of the diffusion equations making predictions from mass accretion 
                rate fluctuations propagating both towards the black hole 
                and away from it. One of the most interesting result is the 
                predictions of soft lags. This suggest a scenario where soft 
                lags could be the result not only of reverbaration but also 
                backword propagation.

                The last example I am going to show you is also the latest

                spoil the results, as Tenyo kawamura talk is just in few minutes,
                but this time they assumed a geometry considering a truncated 
                Shakura sunyaev accretion disk and a stratified hot flow,
                i.e. an hot flow made of two regions characterized by 
                different emissivity and viscosity properties and they also 
                considered reverberation in their study. They qualitatively
                compared model predictions with NICER data and Tenyo will 
                tell you everything about that.

                <h3>Wrapping up: where are we?</h3>
                So, what this introduction and these case of study tell us?
                Where are we? Well, we saw that in the last ten years the 
                propagating fluctuations hypothesis is been applied in 
                different flavours, so using different geometries, to data
                with <em>fluctuating results</em>. We are still far from 
                statistically good fit of the availavle information, but 
                due to the particularly complex nature of this information,
                what it has been done is already remarkable. The point I want 
                to stress here is that we are reaching the point that 
                propagating fluctuation models can be implemented in geometrical 
                scenarios matching the results from spectral analysis. This means 
                that is already possible to use result from spectral analysis 
                to model the stochastic variability, or at least trying to model it.
                Furthermore, the assumption about the fluctuations, their 
                power spectrum, their amplitude, the viscous frequency profile, etc are also 
                quite natural outcomes of MHD simulations or can be linked 
                to the magnetic field configuration in the disk (as turbolence 
                and viscosity are supposed to depend also on the magnetic field),
                so the application of these models can also help us to 
                discern between different hypotheses.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Wrapping up: where are we going?</h3>
                When talking about future developments I see three different paths:
                The first one is the hardcore application of model implementations 
                to data. As I said, the hypothesis can now be combined with 
                several geometrical configurations, but application on data 
                has been scarse compared to the amount of available data. 
                NICER is now providing very high signal to noise data, but it 
                is also true that its band is limited to the low energies, 
                and propagating fluctuation models should be test on broad 
                energy ranges. So, first path, more data.</br>
                The second path is building on what we have, exploring more 
                geometries, making tighter matches between spectral models 
                and propagating fluctuation models, creating a sort of 
                propagating fluctuations lab, where we can explore in great 
                detail propagating fluctuation model predictions in different 
                geometrical scenarios, so to also be able to select the 
                most interesting cases of study.</br>
                The third path is the one if the fundamental assumptions.
                As I mentioned, the idea of propagating fluctuations is quite 
                simple, but to make the machine work you need all sort of assumptions 
                related to how the fluctuations propagate in the accretion flow 
                and how the different parts of the accretion flow talk to each 
                other. What happens when you consider vairiability in reprocessing 
                and reflection? If the inner flow is really precessing 
                producing the QPO, how does this could affect the propagating 
                fluctuations? This kind of research does not necesseraly implies 
                the direct application of propagating fluctuation models,
                but it would be of great help for its future applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Wrapping up: shall we go after all?</h3>
                This was a queastion people asked me several times and we 
                also discussed in my group. We found several cases where 
                the propagating fluctuation model simply does not work, with 
                undeniable qualitative and quantitative descrepancies 
                between model and the data. Doesn't this mean that the hypothesis 
                has been falsified? Well there are two things to consider: 
                propagating fluctuations models are not simple models, 
                they do not make simple prediction such us the swan being black or white. 
                As I showed you, propagating 
                fluctuations models are complex machines made of many 
                assumptions aport from the simple idea of propagating fluctuations.
                It also true that the implementations are described are 
                semi-phenomenological models, they are simplifications of
                more complex mechanism that would need simulations, but that 
                we use because it is not convenient to run a month simulation 
                to fit an observation of 10 minutes. 
                The second point is that it may happen that propagating fluctuations 
                contribute but they are not totally responsible for what we observe. There are 
                study showing that in particular situations, like dipping sources 
                or high winds, both the power spectral shape and the lag spectrum
                can be altered, in those cases becames difficult to find out what 
                contributes to what. This is something we would know extensively applying 
                these models to modre data. In my opinion the 
                hypothesis has not being yet falsified, we basically just started 
                to systematically applying these models to data, and we can 
                still learn a lot trying to model the variability in this way.
                So, shall we go after all? If you are payed for that, why not!

                <h3>Implementing the model: diffusion</h3>
                Let's consider a ring with high density material around
                a black hole. In this case the ring of material is a 50 
                gravitational radii. Because of diffusion this ring will 
                spread in an accretion disk, and if we are close to the black hole
                we will observe local density variations, due to the spread 
                of this outer ring, after a characteristic time called 
                viscous time scale. This is simply a result of the diffusion 
                equation. Now the interesting thing is that, because of this 
                diffusion process, every variation with time scale shorter 
                than the viscous time scale, is highly suppressed.
                Let me show you this with a more specific example.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Implementing the model: damping</h3>
                Let's consider an accretion disk and let's assume to trigger 
                mass accretion rate fluctuations with a very specific wave form 
                far from the black hole, at 50 graviational radii, as indicated 
                by the green arrow. What we want to do is to observe the 
                density fluctuations due to diffusion close to the black hole.
                We decide to give our fluctuations a very specific wave pattern
                made of three sinusoud with three different periods. 
                the first one has a period of half the local viscous frequency,
                the other two have period respectively five and ten time higher than
                the local viscous frequency. Well, what we will observe close 
                to the black hole is that not only the fluctuations are damped,
                as you can see looking at the scale of these plots, but also
                the variability components with period shorter than the local 
                viscous time scale baiscally disappeared. This means that 
                because of diffusion, the propagating fluctuation mechanism
                in the disk works like a low band filter, suppressing All
                the variability with time scale shorter than the local viscous 
                time scale. 
                This is a very important fact when implementing mass accretion 
                rate fluctuation models and it will also make our life much 
                easier as I will show you in the next slide.

            <li>
                <h3>Modelling the variability:spectral assumptions</h3>
                As I said before, any spectral study must always consider 
                the information coming from short time scale variability and
                vice versa. The propagating fluctuations model parameters 
                can also be constrained according to spectral analysis.
                I indentified three different approaches that have been use,
                the easiest one is just considering a very general match 
                between the propagating fluctuation region and the current 
                energy spectrum or accretion state. For example in the low 
                hard state would make sense to consider exploratively a 
                truncated disk geometry or fluctuations propagating only, 
                in the hot flow. The next step is not only to make this 
                assumption, but also measuring the radio between different 
                energy bands in the energy spectrum and setting the emissivities 
                in the disk according to such ratio. In other work, when we model 
                the variability we take into account that the average 
                flux in different energy bands must corresponds to what 
                observed in the energy spectrum, and that is what we have 
                done in our papers together with adam and michiel. The hardest 
                approach is to make a one to one match of spectral components 
                with the propagating fluctuations region and also trying 
                to fit the two information simultaneously, this is something 
                that, for example, rahad Mamoud and Chris Done have tried 
                in their papres in 2018 and 2019. Needless to say, that 
                models that care less of spectral information can be fine 
                tuned to achieve a good agreement with the data, but of course 
                you should always aim to use all the available information.
            </li>
            <li>
                Indeed there may be agreement about the geomtry of accretion 
                in the high-soft state, but when we start talking about 
                low hard state and all sort of intermediate states, spectral 
                analysis can lead to contradictory results.</br>
                <br>
                I always like to mention this very nice study of Javier 
                Garcia on XTE J1752-223 because they basically obtained 
                probably the highest signal to noise energy spectrum 
                ever computed in the low hard state and they could describe
                the data equally well with two quite different geometrical 
                configuration. It is clear that any additional information
                able to break this degeneracy becomes fundamental.
