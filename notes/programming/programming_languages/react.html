                React is another solution for <a href="../programming_concepts/index.html#singlePageApplication">SPAs</a>, it was released
                by Facebook later in 2013. As Angular (Google), Ember, Knockout, 
                and Backbone, React is used to create entire web applications
                in JavaScript [2].

            <h3>Step1: creating your React environment</h3>
            <p>
                <code>npx create-react-app your_react_project</code>
            </p>
            or
            <p>
                <code>npm init react-app your_react_project</code>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>npx</strong> stands for node package executor. You can 
            find more information about <code>create-react-app</code> <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">here</a>. 
            The previous command will create a folder with the name of your app.
            Inside the folder there are a series of sub-folders and files
            containing all you need to start your React project. In particular:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <strong>README.md</strong> markdown file. This is 
                    supposed to briefly describe your project (GitHub style);
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>package.json</strong>, a file containing a list
                    of node package dependencies and oteher project configurations.
                    Going through your package.json file, you will also find the 
                    list of scripts you can use under the <em>scripts</em>
                    property;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>public</strong>, a directory holding all our
                    development files, including the <em>public/index.html</em>
                    file (the single page of our SPA) and the sub-directory 
                    <em>src/</em> containing all the JavaScript code. In 
                    particular the <em>src/App.js</em> file is used to 
                    implement <strong>React components</strong>. Of course, 
                    this is the setup configuration, as you are going to
                    develop your project you may want to organize your 
                    components into different files;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <code>create-react-app</code> will also configure tools such 
            us webpack and Babel, so that you do not need to worry about those.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="step2">
            <h3>Step2: Start the app in developer mode</h3>
            <p>
                <code>npm start</code>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="step3">
            <h3>Step3: Run the tests</h3>
            <p>
                <code>npm test</code>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="step4">
            <h3>Step4: Build the aoo for production</h3>
            <p>
                <code>npm run build</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                This command will create a <em>build</em> directory that 
                can be used to deploy your application;

        <h2>About JSX</h2>
        <p>
            JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is not mandatory 
            to use JSX in order to use React (as it is not mandatory to use 
            React to implement SPA), but it makes life a lot easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>JSX main features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    JavaScript variables (variables that have been declared
                    at a certain point either using const or let) can be 
                    used inside JSX wrapping them around curly braces (e.g. {my_variable}).
                    You can actually put entire Javascript expressions inside 
                    curly braces;
                </li>
                <li>JSX expressions can be used inside conditaional statements,
                    for loops, assigned to variables, accepted as arguments,
                    and returned by functions. This is all because JSX statements
                    are translatedinto JavaScript during compilation;
                </li>
                <li>
                    In JSX object properties use the camelCase convention,
                    the same of JavaScript functions. So that HTML class and 
                    tabindex become className and tabIndex in JSX;
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Practical tips</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>From my very first coding of mdn example in codepen</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember to declare all the variable either with let or const;</li>
                <li>It's ReactDOM not ReactDom;</li>
                <li>
                    Do you want to place a React component inside an html element? Then:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give that element a unique ID (myid);</li>
                        <li>
                            Create a React root for the supplied container
                            using <code>root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('myid'));</code>;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the just created root to render the react 
                            element using <code>root.render(&#60 MyReactElement args={whatever} /&#62)</code>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    !!! When you create a list of elements, you should give
                    to each element a unique ID, so that React can identify
                    which item changed.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
