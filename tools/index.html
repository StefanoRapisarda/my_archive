                        Atomizer is a tool that helps you create Atomic 
                        CSS rules (acss.io). Atomic CSS is a collection 
                        of single purpose styling units for maximum 
                        reuse that fits well with components in 
                        templated frameworks such as React, Ember or 
                        Angular. For more information we recommend 
                        that you read "Challenging CSS best practices", 
                        watch the Atomic CSS presentation, or check 
                        this deck.

                        It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had 
                        to design user interfaces, write code in multiple 
                        languages and frameworks, and understand how all 
                        of that code works together.<br>
                        Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started 
                        with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. 
                        This creates more problems than it solves.<br>
                        Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity 
                        and flexibility, but they can also be limited in 
                        different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.<br>
                        Openblocks wants to take a step forward. More 
                        specifically, Openblocks is 1) An all-in-one IDE to 
                        create internal or customer-facing apps; 2) A place 
                        to create, build and share building blocks of web 
                        applications; 3) A domain-specific language that 
                        UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.
