        <h1>Lists or Tuples?</h1>
        <p>
            The weekly email pointed at an article on medium that I could
            not read because my subscription had expired... anyhow. <br>
            I googled a bit to refresh the main concepts and:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tuples are immutable, lists are not, therefore tuples 
                have fixed length and can be used as dictionary index;
            </li>
            <li>
                Tuples are stored more efficiently, so for large number
                of items can be read faster than lists and occupy less 
                space <span class=""Python Coding Methods">(you can 
                    check the space occupied in bytes by an object either 
                    with the method __sizeof__() or with the function 
                    sys.getsizeof())</span>;
            </li>
            <li>
                Tuples give the programmer and the interpreter a hint
                that the data should not be changed;
            </li>
        </ul>
        Information found mainly <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-vs-tuples#:~:text=The%20literal%20syntax%20of%20tuples,more%20functionality%20than%20the%20tuple.">here</a>.

    <div class="Python Coding GoodPractices PEP">
        <h1>Abount PEP</h1>
        <p>
            <span style="color:blue">DEF:</span> PEPs are documents 
            that propose new Python features and serve as official
            documentation for the feature while the Python community
            debates its acceptance or rejection. PEP stands for Python
            Enhancement Proposal;
        </p>
        <p>
            Among all PEPs, PEP8 is Python's official style guide. Some 
            of the "rules" in PEP8 are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use four spaces instead of a tab character for indentation;</li>
            <li>The maximum line length is 79 characters;</li>
            <li>Functions and variable names should follow the
                <code>lowercase_with_underscores</code> style;
            </li>
            <li>Class names should use the <code>CapitalizeWords</code>
            style;</li>
            <li>
                Write constants in the <code>UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE</code>
                style;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are tools to check if you are "respecting" the rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>flake8: install it with <scan>pip install flake8</scan>
            and run it with <code>flake8 myscript.py</code>;</li>
            <li>You can set VS Code to lint your code with flake8;</li>
            <li>
                <code>black</code> is an auto-formatter that you can install
                with <code>pip install black</code>. <code>black --check myscript.py</code>
                will check your script to see if there is any change to do.
                <code>black --diff myscript.py</code> is to check which
                changes black would make. <code>black myscript.py</code> will
                automatically format the file.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Making your code more "Pythonic"</h1>
        <p>
            Apart from following PEP8 for your formatting, there are few
            things to remember to make your python code more efficient:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Instead of iterating over an index, try to iterate over
                items in a list (or anything iterable) directly;
            </li>
            <li>
                Use list comprehension when possible (I never noticed 
                that list comprehension syntax is very symilar to the 
                <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation">set-builder notation</a>)
                for writing sets ("insiemi") in mathematics);
            </li>
            <li>
                Use built-in functions when possible. A good example is 
                finding the amount of words starting with A in a list:
                <code>sum([item.startswith("A") for item in items])</code>;
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember that in python True and False are 1 and 0 in 
                disguise;
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember you can also write dictionary comprehensions
                list list comprehensions;
            </li>
            <li>
                Use sets to remove duplicates from a list: <code>
                    unique_items = list(set(items))
                </code>.<br>
                Sets can also be used to get differences between two...
                sets of items;
            </li>

        </ul>
