        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="question">
                    <u>
                        <em>You implemented solutions for a broad variety of data related problems, could you give us some examples?</em>
                    </u>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        <strong>GUIDELINE:</strong> talk about your experience with data reduction from satellites;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I always worked with data from satellites. These data are usually publicly available online. The data 
                        are organised according to target, the source that the satellite observes, and observations, a continous
                        interval of time that the satellite spent observing that target.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therefore, these data have to be first downloaded and stored locally. Each satellite has different 
                        characteristics, for example some orbit quite far from Earth while another, in particular, is attached
                        to the international space station. So, according to the satellite, data have to be cleaned and filtered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then data need to be reduced into a higher level data, the ones that it's actually needed to perform
                        research, and analysed. Usually I perform a preliminary analysis to check if something interesting 
                        showing up and also a deeper statistical analysis on specic cases. For both these phases visualization
                        is fundamental as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So for broad variety of problems I mean indeed downloading, storing, cleaning, filtering, reducing, 
                        analysing and creating higher level data, designing a format for this high level data, designing their 
                        corresponding meta_data, and quickly visualising these data as well in different formats (an interactive
                        plot, a pdf etc.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of structure also it is necessary to find the most simple storing structures for a certain 
                        data set;
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">
                    <em>How do you deal with large databases?</em>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        This of course depends on a specific case, but in general I would try to access first how big or
                        how big is going to be the dataset, the kind of data to be stored (tables, images, etc), and some other
                        information about accessing the data, for example how many times the data need to be accessed during
                        the research project, which kind of speed is required, and which kind of analysis will be perfomed and 
                        how.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step would be trying to find optimal solutions for these database characteristics, always 
                        keeping an eye at the cost of these characteristics, and then presenting and explaining pro and cons of
                        these solutions to the researcher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a more technical point of view, I would suggest to make a copy of the raw data, so that the 
                        original raw data cannot be manipulated directly. It is also important to keep track of all the operations
                        perfomed on raw data, this can be done via metadata or using version control software for files. The 
                        principle is the same of git but these work for files, Zenodo and Dat are possible technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creating optimal metadata is very also important, when writing metadata I always think them as messages 
                        for my future self and my future self is a dumper and slower version of my present self and he forgot
                        everything about the database, so it has to be information structured in a way to be easely interpreted 
                        without previous knowledge of the dataset structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every analysis also should be done in a self contained computing environment (using docker container or
                        any kind of virtual environment for example) in a way that not only you can reproduce the same result 
                        using the same software, but also, eventually, figuring out the cause of possible errors and mistakes.
                    </p>

                            flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency;

                        I try to be sure that the raw data used for my research project are publicly available and I give detailed description
                        on which dataset has been used. I also make detailed documentation of all the operations perfomed on data and I make
                        available on internet the higher level data produced and the software that has been used;

                        I am subscribed to several newsletter reguarding data science, software developement, and in general the 
                        tech world. For example TLDR and pycoder weekly are among my favourite. I like TLDR because it organises articles in
                        terms of the time you are supposed to spend to read it. I am also memeber of facebook groups related to 
                        the data science world and I can follow up the news from there. I also follow website like kaggle, medium.com, 
                        and towardsdatascience.com.

                        Thinking long-term, in particular estimating future size and use of a database. Database can grow very 
                        complex with time and with the rapid change of technology, designing database effective solutions that can 
                        last over time is, in my opinion, the greatest challenge;

                        Data corruption or damage that goes under the radar and it is not noticed by the researcher. That would 
                        mean that scientific results will be based on false evidence and that is worse than loosing completely
                        the data;
