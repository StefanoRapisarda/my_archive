            <div class="BookTitle">The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book ðŸ“–</div>
            <div class="BookAuthor">Andriy Burkov</div>
            <div class="BookYear">2019</div>
            <div class="BookSummary">
                Is it possible to explain various machine learning 
                topics in a mere 100 pages? The Hundred-Page Machine 
                Learning Book by Andriy Burkov is an effort to realize 
                the same. Written in an easy-to-comprehend manner, 
                the machine learning book is endorsed by reputed thought 
                leaders to the likes of the Director of Research at Google, 
                Peter Norvig and Sujeet Varakhedi, Head of Engineering at 
                eBay. It is the best books for Machine Learning to start with.<br>
                Post a thorough reading of the book, you will be able to 
                build and appreciate complex AI systems, clear an ML-based 
                interview, and even start your very own ml-based business. 
                The book, however, is not meant for absolute machine 
                learning beginners. If youâ€™re looking for something more 
                fundamental look somewhere else.

            <div class="BookTitle">Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications ðŸ“–</div>
            <div class="BookAuthor">Toby Segaran</div>
            <div class="BookYear">2007</div>
            <div class="BookSummary">
                Regarded among the best books to begin understanding 
                machine learning, the Programming Collective Intelligence 
                by Toby Segaran was written way before, in 2007, data 
                science and machine learning reached its present status 
                of top career avenues. The book makes use of Python as 
                the vehicle of delivering the knowledge to its readers.<br>
                The Programming Collective Intelligence is less of an 
                introduction to machine learning and more of a guide for 
                implementing ml. The book details on creating efficient 
                ml algorithms for gathering data from applications, 
                creating programs for accessing data from websites, and 
                inferring the gathered data. Each chapter features 
                exercises for extending the stated algorithms and 
                further improving their efficiency and effectiveness.

            <div class="BookYear">2011</div>
            <div class="BookSummary">
                Written by Christopher M. Bishop, the Pattern Recognition 
                and Machine Learning book serves as an excellent reference 
                for understanding and using statistical techniques in 
                machine learning and pattern recognition. A sound 
                understanding of linear algebra and multivariate calculus 
                are prerequisites for going through the machine learning book.<br>
                The Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book present 
                detailed practice exercises for offering a comprehensive 
                introduction to statistical pattern recognition techniques. 
                The book leverages graphical models in a unique way of 
                describing probability distributions. Though not mandatory, 
                some experience with probability will hasten the learning process.
