                    <h3>On the importance on data/software planning</h3>
                    <p>
                        People expect that the most difficoult and costly phase
                        in the lifecycle of a database/software development
                        is the initial development: you need to figure out how 
                        to implement the features of your database/software, often 
                        all the feature you will need are not completely clear in 
                        your mind, you have to figure out how to implement them, 
                        and most probably you will have to phase a lot of new 
                        concepts. This is also the time when, more or less conssciously,
                        you will take shortcuts as, quite understandably, you wish
                        your software/database to work as soon as possible.
                        Well, as a matter of fact, the hardest part comes later, 
                        during the maintenance phase. That is the phase where 
                        programmers/researchers pay the price for all the shortcuts 
                        they took during developments. It is indeed quite common 
                        for database/software to grow in complexity with time,
                        a complexity they have not been initially designed for.

                        complexity of even look for examples in architecture</em>]
