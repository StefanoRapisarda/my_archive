                Javascript is the language of the web. [...] Different browsers
                have different JavaScript interpreters which execute JavaScript code. [1]

                JavaScript is a scripting languange that is one of the 
                three core languages used to develop websites. Whereas
                HTML and CSS give a website strucure and style, Javascript
                lets you add functionality and behaviors to your website,
                allowing your website's visitors to interact with content 
                in many imaginative ways.
                <br>
                JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, meaning
                it runs on your computer within your browser. However,
                more recently the introduction of Node.js has allowed
                JavaScript to also execute code on servers. [2]

                Javascript <a href="../programming_concepts/index.html#specification"><strong>specifications</strong></a>
                are indicated by <strong>ES</strong> and a number (e.g. ES6). 
                ES stands for ECMAScript, where ECMA is the European Computer Manufacturers Association.

    <section id="classes">
        <h2>Classes</h2>
        You may often find online that classes have been implemented in 
        JavaScript starting from ES6, however class definition has <em>always</em>
        been allowed in JavaScript, but ES6 introduced a new, more convenient,
        syntax using the <code>class</code> keyword.<br>
        Here I list the main things to remember about classes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Classes are defined in this way: <code>class ClassName {}</code>. 
                In JavaScript classes start with capital letters (like in python) and 
                the curly braces contain the body of the class declaration;
            </li>
            <li>
                Classes are initialized with the <code>constructor</code>
                method (<code>constructor(args) {}</code>). Inside the constructor,
                class properties are referred using the word <code>this</code> (
                <code>this.attr1 = 1;</code>). Recently, a new syntax has 
                been approved, you can write the properties (or <em>fields</em>)
                of the class at the beginning of the class body simply
                listing the name of the fields and their value (<code>attr1 = 1;</code>).
                Using this latter syntax you can also define variable that
                are accessible only inside the classe: <code>#attr = 1</code>.
                Remember that in both syntaxes, not variable declaration is 
                necessary.<br> 
                The constractor function is equivalent to __init__() in python;
            </li>
            <li>
                Methods are defined in this way: <code>methodName(args) {}</code>. 
                Contrary to python (where underscored are uside in function 
                names), in Javascript the name convetion for methods (and 
                functions in general) is words separated by capital letters;
            </li>
            <li>
                Inheritance is achieved with the word <code>extends</code>:
                <code>class ClassName extends ParentClass {}</code>. In order
                to inherit all the properties of the parent classe, you need
                to use <code>super()</code> in the constructor of the child
                class;
            </li>
            <li>
                Static (or class) methods are methods invoked on the class constructor, 
                while standard methods are invoked on a class instance. In 
                order to define standard static methods you simply need
                to use the prefix <code>static</code> before the method;
            </li>
            <li>
                !!! When you define functions in javascript, that piece
                of code is executed at the beginning of your script. Even 
                if the class declaration looks similar to the function 
                declaration, this is not true for classes, so classes 
                must be defined before being used.
            </li>
        </ul>
