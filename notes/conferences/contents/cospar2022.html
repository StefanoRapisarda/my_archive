            <h3>To mention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To properly make prediction of the full timing properties
                    (QPOs + noise), we need to fully understand the relation
                    between disk and corona, how they talk to each other 
                    and what happens in different time scales;
                </li>
                <li>
                    The all story of the bending wave radius;
                </li>
                <li>
                    The viscous frequency determines both the characteristic
                    frequency at which the fluctuation at a given radius is 
                    generated and the radial velocity through the flow. This 
                    corresponds to the physical picture that the variability faster 
                    than the viscous time-scales is attenuated through the 
                    diffusion and that the mass accretion happens in the 
                    viscous time-scales (Churazov et al. 2001; Ingram 2016) [1]
                </li>
                <li>
                    These works (for example mine and [1]) show that, despite
                    we cannot yet obtain a precise prediction of the data with 
                    the propagating fluctuations models, we can make them
                    run in geometrical scenarios that match results from 
                    spectral modelling. This could be of great help in 
                    discerning between conflicts of spectral models that
                    fit equally well the data;
                </li>
                <li>
                    When talking about propagating fluctuation models it
                    comes often out the word "linearity". The discussion 
                    about linearity is related to the question: how does 
                    the energy spectrum react when the mass accretion rate 
                    change? In a linear case, variations of the normalization 
                    of the energy spectrum at all energy and the mass accretion 
                    rate have the same sign and the same amplitude.
                    However, reality can be different from the linear case.
                    For example, we now that the power-law index of the Compton 
                    region depends on two parameters: electron temperature of 
                    the hot flow and optical depth. Mass accretion rate fluctuations 
                    may trigger variations that works on opposite side. 
                    Fluctuations propagating from the disc may cause variations
                    in the seed photons, and so electron temperature of the 
                    hot flow region that is closest to the disk, and variations 
                    in the optical depths, causing a pivoting of the power law 
                    and so a non-linear response to propagating fluctuations.

                        Spectral studies of the <strong>low/hard state</strong> in black hole
                        binaries lead to <strong>conflicting conclusions</strong> about 
                        the nature and geometry of the accretion flow [1];

                        The hard Comptonized continuum spectra seen in the low/hard state
                        cannot arise from an isotropically emitting corona over the inner 
                        accretion disc (Poutanen et al. 2018) [1];

                    [1] showed that reverbetation is a fundamental process 
                    to include in propagating fluctuation models. Not only 
                    because there is clear evidence of it in spectral anlysis,
                    but also because (in the framework of propagating fluctuations),
                    it is needed to obtain the soft lag at high frequency.

            <h3>General considerations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In spectral analisys, the truncation radius is estimated 
                    mainly from observations of the broadening of the Iron 
                    line and from the normalization of the multi-temperature 
                    blackbody component;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implementing mass accretion rate models using the 
                    Timmer & Koenig prescription is not appropriate for two
                    main reasons: 1) In order to obtain the power spectrum
                    you should average over many realization of the process,
                    this means that a single "propagation" through the disk 
                    would be an incorrect prediction of the power spectrum;
                    2) The process is computationally expensive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Model contraddiction and descrepancies between model 
                    and data seem to occur mainly during intermidiate states,
                    when the energy spectrum may be composed of two Comptonization
                    continua [3].
                </li>
                <li>
                    It seems that one of the main efforts in modelling, and 
                    also phenomenological studies, is trying to describe 
                    the accretion states observed in X-ray binaries in terms
                    of few parameters, namely mass accretion rate (inderectly
                    related to angular momentum transport and so magnetic
                    field structure), black hole mass, black hole spin, and 
                    inclination;

                    In the case of XTE J1752−223, Garcia et al. (2018) analysed 
                    very high signal to noise RXTE observations averaging a large number
                    of "stable" (in terms of luminosity and hardness) hard state 
                    observations (~300 ks). The analysis led to a quite small inner
                    disk radius measurement (1.7 &#177 0.4 Rg). This is at odd 
                    with the truncated disc model. Furthermore they found that 
                    the data can almost equally well described with either an 
                    extended coronal model or a lampost geometry;

                    [3] Truncated cold disc and hot accretion flow <strong>within</strong>
                    its inner boundaries. The hot accretion flow radiates
                    in the X-rays via proceeding Comptonization processes.
                    The seed photons are coming from both the cold disc and 
                    the self-generated synchrotron emission.
                    Mass accretion rate fluctuations are stirred up in the 
                    disk region closeset to the accretion flow and in the particle 
                    density of in the hot accretion flow. Because here we 
                    have both Compton up-scattering of seed photons and 
                    synchrotron photons coming from the flow itself, these 
                    variations lead to changes of the X-ray flux: first time, 
                    through the disc Comptonization in the region close 
                    to the disc truncation radius, and second time, through 
                    the synchrotron Comptonization in the region close 
                    to the black hole (within about 30–50 Schwarzschild radii).
                    These two hard variable emissions may interfere with
                    each either leading to complex power spectral shape.
                    The main difference betweeh this scenario and the others,
                    is that, instead of having a propagation region rigidly
                    stratified, we have hot flow components significantly
                    contributing to hard and soft band. 
                    Presence of two components in the light curves cause 
                    interference picture in their power and cross-spectra 
                    and oscillatory behaviour of the phase/time lags.

                    When showing how a standard power spectrum in computed,
                    when I describe how single power psectra are averaged,
                    I can use exactly the same words of [1] to justify the 
                    operation: <em>the power spectra of single data blocks

                    It True that according to [2] you can measure damping
                    time and resonant frequency fitting the QPO with a 
                    Lorentzian, but the data we fit is usually the result 
                    of average of hundreds segments, so information retrieved 
                    in this way does not really tells us much about the 
                    properties of the oscillations in a single segment;
