            A technical writer is a professional wordsmith who condenses and
            simplifies complicated topics, such as artificial intelligence or
            augmented reality, to create user manuals, online reference
            documentation, customer service guides for a company‚Äôs help desk, and
            other types of content.<br />
            Technical writing requires a deep level of understanding of the topic
            being covered. Technical writers often have experience as engineers,
            design and drafting professionals, and other related careers. Some
            technical writers, however,
            <em
              >can conceptualize information and break it down without having
              hands-on experience.</em
            >
            Neither type is innately better; each has its strengths.<br />

              A technical writer is someone who transforms complex and 
              technically difficult written material into clear and concise 
              documentation that will be read by target audiences. They 
              gather and develop technical information in order to create 
              maintenance and operating instructions, technical and 
              instructional manuals, journal articles, and other documentation 
              for manufacturers, designers, and clients.<br>
              Technical writers can be found working in many areas, such 
              as technology, engineering, medicine, and the sciences.

              A technical writer prides him/herself on having <strong>excellent 
              language, writing, and communication skills</strong>, and strives 
              to create <strong>professional and error-free documentation</strong>
              in order to establish credibility with the audience. 
              Technical writers also have excellent <strong>research and 
              exploration skills</strong>, and carry out extensive research in 
              order to create a document that communicates information in 
              clear, useful terms. This, in turn, helps the reader find, 
              understand, and use what they read appropriately.<br>
              When given an assignment, the technical writer must <strong>first 
              analyze the target audience</strong> in order to define what they 
              will require. The sound or feel of a document is governed by 
              the targeted audience and the document type. Accurate audience 
              analysis will shape what the document's presentation, design, 
              and content will be like, and define whether the communication 
              will be <strong>lighthearted, humorous, formal, or professional.</strong><br>            
              Analyzing the target audience will also help to define the 
              tone and knowledge level of the document, and tailor it 
              specifically. For example, software documentation tends to 
              be very clear and simple, so that inexperienced users can 
              easily follow it, whereas medical procedures used by physicians 
              may be less simplified, because it assumes that the reader 
              already has knowledge in the field.<br>
              The following are a few questions a technical writer may ask 
              themselves at the outset of a document:
              <ul>
              <li>who will the target audience be?</li>
              <li>what is the knowledge level of the audience?</li>
              <li>what is the role of the audience?</li>
              <li>what is the task of the audience?</li>
              <li>what is the purpose of the document?</li>
              </ul>
              Another component of technical writing is <strong>document design.</strong> 
              The technical writer will look at how to use images, lists, 
              charts, and headings in order to increase usability. 
              They will put emphasis on important sections, such as 
              'useful tips', or 'warning' sections, by using various colours, 
              bolding, type sizes, and fonts. The technical writer must at 
              the same time keep in mind that overly complex graphs, 
              ornateness, too many headings, illegible font, etc., 
              will hinder the reader's comprehension. Therefore, 
              keeping everything clear and concise, and keeping out the 
              'visual noise' and 'visual bulk' is the technical writer's 
              main design strategy. After completion, a document is usually 
              submitted for editing, and after approval, published in the 
              appropriate venue.
